## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User goals of use 

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want everyone to enjoy and be pulled into the new narrative of Unified Worship.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want the visitor to feel updated about when the new site is going to be launched. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want the viewer to feel compelled to come back and use the website and be engaged with the new updates. 
    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want them to feel knowledgeable about the new updates. 
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want the customers to feel welcomed to see how much time the site has left. 
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want them to feel on the cutiing edge of the design. 

-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The main colors used are white(elegance), blue (welcoming and trusted), grey(cutting edge).
    -   #### Typography
        -   I downloaded the Poppins library for my font. Which can be found on Adobe. They have many different stles and I used the black and regular fonts.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is the most beautiful part. The first main image gives a mountain top experiance, showing how the viewer should feel after reading the book. I wanted to position the customer as the hero and show their victory first and formost.

-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, iPhone 7 and 8 & iPhone X.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

### Known Bugs

-   On some devices the "coming soon" looks packed inside there.
    -  On some small devices sizes the logo looks extra large.


### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...

### Content and credits 

-   Content was written by the developer Samuel Levine with use of templates and samples from other sources. Snipits and ideas from Bootstrap, Animate, Moment, JQuery, Colorlib, Hover.css

- Visual studio was used for some parts of code. Git Pod was having issues. This is why the code was commited in a different timeline. My mentor said I needed to make you aware that I was not aware of how to use VS and Git pod connectivity for commit history.
